# ABM_ForestFire
##### An agent based model to explore strategies to combat forest fires.

As wildfires threaten Northwest America it becomes increasingly important to design ways to contain a fire soon after its ignition. Given a fires origin, the environment and a constrained amount of fire prevention material, we propose a resource optimization scheme for fire containment to maximize unaffected land.Rational artificial agents are en-tasked with laying down fire breaks in real time as the fire spreads. Several fire prevention strategies are tested and compared. Fire prevention methods are simulated on a  semi-synchronous fire propagation model. The model aims to maximize tree yield while minimizing time-of-containment and number of agents required to contain the fire. These simulations can inform real fire fighting efforts after a fire has begun. Ideas are inspired from Highly Optimized Tolerance models and other agent based spreading models.
